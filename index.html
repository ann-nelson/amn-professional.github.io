    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <img src="Medium.png" alt="Your Name" style="width: 200px; height: 200px;">
    <p>Meet Ann Nelson, a dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a concentration in Information Technology. Originally from Virginia, I moved to North Carolina in 2016 in pursuit of my academic goals.</p>
    <p>Besides my studies, I play a role as an Employer Engagement Assistant at the University Career Center. In this role, I meticulously vet and approve employers and opportunities for University of North Carolina at Charlotte (UNCC) students and alumni, ensuring they have access to high-quality and relevant career prospects.</p>
    <p>Outside of my academic and professional commitments, I cherish the time with my family. Whether it's watching movies, baking, or simply unwinding, I value moments of relaxation amidst my busy schedule. With my passion for my education, dedication to my work, and commitment to fostering career opportunities for my peers, I pursue to exemplify drive and excellence in both my academic and personal pursuits.</p>
